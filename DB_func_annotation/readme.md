## Terms explanation
### Subsection "Performance evaluation for gene functional annotation"
* "known genes" refers to "positive cases (set |K|)" in the paper
* "unknown genes" refers to "negative cases (set |U|)" in the paper

****

## Files explanation
* XXXX_known_gene: the intersection of the download gene set from [GSEA-MsigDB](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/)
* XXXX_unknown_gene: the randomly selected genes from the mouse cortex expression dataset excepted genes in the above intersection.
> We provide these two files only for the four gene function types that were used in our paper. If user requires the custom gene sets, please contact with me (Yu XU) or generate the files by self followed the instruction.  

* XXXX_gene_pairs_train: the benchmark gene pairs used to train.
* XXXX_gene_pairs_test: the benchmark gene pairs used to test.
* XXXX_count_set_test: the scope of gene pairs coressponding with each positive gene in test set.
> These three file were generated by running the python script `generate_input_funcassign.py`
